For example, CONFIG message might include the CPU type, the graphics depth, the GUI look-and-feel, etc. This level is initialized to `700`."

The exact meaning of the three levels will vary between subsystems, but in general, FINEST should be used for the most voluminous detailed output, FINER for somewhat less detailed output, and FINE for the  lowest volume (and most important) messages.\n\nIn general the FINE level should be used for information that will be broadly interesting to developers who do not have a specialized interest in the specific subsystem.\n\nFINE messages might include things like minor (recoverable) failures.  Issues indicating potential performance problems are also worth logging as FINE. This level is initialized to `500`."
